This project analyzes key logistics and sales data from the Global Superstore dataset to identify insights related to sales trends, shipping efficiency, stock management, and profitability.
Key Visualizations and Insights1. Top 10 Best-Selling Products (Bar Chart)A few products dominate sales, indicating a Pareto effect (80-20 rule).
Actionable Insight: Prioritize inventory and marketing efforts on high-performing products.
2. Sales Trend Over Time (Line Chart)Sales show seasonal trends, requiring stock and marketing adjustments.
Actionable Insight: Use demand forecasting to optimize inventory.
3. Impact of Discount on Sales (Scatter Plot)Discounts drive sales but may reduce profitability.
Actionable Insight: Implement targeted discount strategies rather than blanket discounts.
4. Distribution of Ordered Quantities (Histogram)Most orders are small, suggesting demand for low-volume sales.
Actionable Insight: Offer bulk incentives and optimize packaging.
5. Shipping Cost vs. Profit (Scatter Plot)Higher shipping costs impact profitability.
Actionable Insight: Optimize carrier selection and explore free shipping thresholds.
6. Average Shipping Delay by Region (Bar Chart)Some regions experience significant shipping delays.
Actionable Insight: Improve logistics partnerships and warehouse distribution.
7. Late Shipment Prediction (Gauge Chart)High late shipment rate impacts customer satisfaction.
Actionable Insight: Automate warehouse processes and use multiple carriers.
8. Profitability by Market (Bar Chart)Some regions generate higher profits despite lower sales volume.
Actionable Insight: Optimize regional pricing and cost structures.
9. Stockout Probability & Reorder Point (Histogram)Frequent stockouts suggest demand forecasting issues.
Actionable Insight: Use AI-driven inventory management to prevent lost sales.
